## Building APK on Your Phone

Since you don't have a laptop/PC, here are several options to build the APK using your Vivo phone:

### Option 1: GitHub Actions (Recommended)
1. Export this project to GitHub using the GitHub button in Lovable
2. Copy the `build-android.yml` file to `.github/workflows/` in your repository
3. Push changes to trigger the build
4. Download the APK from the Actions artifacts

### Option 2: Cloud IDEs
Use one of these cloud-based development environments on your phone:

**Gitpod:**
1. Go to gitpod.io
2. Open your GitHub repository
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Build: `npm run build`
5. Add Android: `npx cap add android`
6. Sync: `npx cap sync android`
7. Build APK: `cd android && ./gradlew assembleDebug`

**CodeSandbox:**
1. Import your GitHub repo to CodeSandbox
2. Open terminal and run build commands
3. Download the generated APK

### Option 3: Termux (Android Terminal)
Install Termux from F-Droid and run:
```bash
pkg install nodejs git openjdk-17
git clone your-repo-url
cd your-project
npm install
npm run build
npx cap add android
npx cap sync android
cd android
./gradlew assembleDebug
```
